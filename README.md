## ✨ Features
- **Deep CNN Model:** Effectively classifies various wheat leaf diseases.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Easy to train and test the model with simple commands.
- **Visualization Tools:** Graphical representations of training metrics and model performance.
- **Extensive Documentation:** Well-commented code and comprehensive user guides.

## 📦 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
To get started, ensure you have the following software installed:
- **Python 3.6 or higher**
- **TensorFlow 2.x** (or Keras)
- **OpenCV**
- **NumPy**
- **Matplotlib**

### Installation
1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/deep-cnn-wheat-disease-detection.git
   cd deep-cnn-wheat-disease-detection
Install the required packages:
bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt

**->🛠️ Usage**
Training the Model
Prepare your dataset and run the following command:
python train.py --data_dir path_to_your_dataset --epochs 50

**Making Predictions**

To classify an image of a wheat leaf:
python predict.py --image path_to_image

**📈 Training Process**
Data Augmentation: Enhances model generalization.
Epochs: Trained over a specified number of epochs.
Model Saving: Best-performing model weights are saved.
🎉 Results
The model's performance is evaluated through accuracy and loss metrics, which are logged during training. Sample results and visualizations are available in the results directory.

**->📊 Dataset**
In total, there are 4800 images in the dataset where

-> 1279 Healthy Wheat
-> 939 Wheat Loose Smut
-> 1622 Leaf Rust
-> 860 (after refining) Crown and Root Rot

**-> Model**
A new kind of technique has been used (by trying to browse through the many sources) of dividing every type of plant image into a binary array – four arrays have been used – to get a preferable and smooth way of classifying the images along with the help of Neural Networks.Even in a small cycle of 30 epochs only (as a check of the identifying model’s result), the accuracy score was a favourable 87.31%. Looking at the results, possible accuracy of 87.31% has been attained.

**->🏗️ Model Architecture**
The architecture consists of:

Convolutional Layers: For feature extraction.
Max Pooling Layers: To reduce dimensionality.
Dropout Layers: To prevent overfitting.
Fully Connected Layers: For final classification.
For a detailed model structure, refer to the model.py file.
