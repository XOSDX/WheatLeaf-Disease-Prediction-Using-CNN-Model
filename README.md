AI-for-Wheat-Disease
During my time in the University , I built a Deep Learning model that can predict whether among many wheat leaves, which is diseased and 
which is not with acceptable scores and assist the user, majorly the farmers to distinguish between the healthy and diseased wheat plants.

Dataset
In totoal, there are 4800 images in the dataset where

1279 Healthy Wheat
939 Wheat Loose Smut
1622 Leaf Rust
860 (after refining) Crown and Root Rot

Model
A new kind of technique has been used (by trying to browse through the many sources) of dividing every type of plant image into a binary array – four arrays have been used – to get a preferable and 
smooth way of classifying the images along with the help of Neural Networks.Even in a small cycle of 30 epochs only (as a check of the identifying model’s result), the accuracy score was a favourable
87.31%. Looking at the results, possible accuracy of 31% has been attained.
